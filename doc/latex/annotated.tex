\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_board}{Board}} }{\pageref{class_board}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_body}{G\+L\+Body}} \\*A 3D body that uses a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_e_s_renderer}{G\+L\+E\+S\+Renderer}} for drawing and \mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_point}{G\+L\+Point}} objects for defining its surface }{\pageref{class_g_l_body}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_color_rgba}{G\+L\+Color\+Rgba}} \\*The Gl\+Color\+Rgba class is a convenience class to replace Q\+Vector4D for color variables }{\pageref{class_g_l_color_rgba}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_disc}{G\+L\+Disc}} }{\pageref{class_g_l_disc}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_e_s_renderer}{G\+L\+E\+S\+Renderer}} \\*A render program that can be used as a simple replacement for the Open\+GL fixed function pipeline }{\pageref{class_g_l_e_s_renderer}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_item}{G\+L\+Item}} \\*The Gl\+Item class is a 3D-\/scene item designed for use in Q\+ML Scene\+Graphs. It should be subclassed according to your requirements, registered with qml\+Register\+Type and used as a component in Q\+ML files. The default constructor will use src/vshader.\+vsh and src/fshader.\+fsh as shaders. Fell free to use shaders of your own. Refer to the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_e_s_renderer}{G\+L\+E\+S\+Renderer}} class for shader requirements. Geometry data should be put into m\+\_\+points and m\+\_\+vertices containers for maximum performance. Use paint\+Under\+Qml or paint\+On\+Top\+Of\+Qml to paint a 3D scene under or on top of the Q\+ML elements of the Q\+ML Scene\+Graph. For debugging geometries, call toggle\+Move to let the scene rotate around m\+\_\+rotation\+Axis. Warning\+: Updating geometry data must be carried out in synchronize\+Threads, because drawing will be performed on the rendering thread. The rendering thread is waiting when synchronize\+Threads is called }{\pageref{class_g_l_item}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_g_l_point}{G\+L\+Point}} \\*A Point containing data for a surface point. This class is used in binary read and write functions. DO N\+OT add virtual methods, DO N\+OT change order of declarations. xxx\+Pointer methods return the addresses needed by Open\+GL attribute functions }{\pageref{class_g_l_point}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_my_gl_item}{My\+Gl\+Item}} }{\pageref{class_my_gl_item}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_shader_debugger}{Shader\+Debugger}} \\*A simple debugging tool for uniforms passed to a shader }{\pageref{class_shader_debugger}}{}
